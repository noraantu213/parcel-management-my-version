## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Convert Excel Sheets to TXT
Run the Python conversion script to extract the requirements from `Sprint_2.xlsx`:
```bash
python convert_xlsx_to_txt.py
```
*Extracted text files will be stored in the `txt_output/` folder.*

---

### 2. Start Java Spring Boot Backend
Open a terminal in the project directory:

```bash
cd backend
```

**Run using the included portable Maven:**
- **On Windows (PowerShell / CMD):**
  ```powershell
  & ".\maven\apache-maven-3.9.8\bin\mvn.cmd" spring-boot:run
  ```
- **Or if Maven (`mvn`) is installed globally:**
  ```bash
  mvn spring-boot:run
  ```

*Backend server will start on: **`http://localhost:8080`***

---

### 3. Start Angular 18 Frontend
Open a new terminal window:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npx ng serve --port 4200
```

*Open your browser and navigate to: **`http://localhost:4200`***

---

### 4. (Optional) Run Automated API Tests
To verify all 13 backend endpoints, cost calculations, status flows, and validation rules:

```bash
python test_backend_api.py
```

## 💰 Service Cost Calculation Formula

The application computes service costs according to the following formula:

$$\text{Customer Cost} = (\text{Base Rate} + \text{Weight Charge} + \text{Delivery Charge} + \text{Packing Charge}) \times (1 + \text{Tax Rate})$$

$$\text{Officer Cost} = (\text{Base Rate} + \text{Weight Charge} + \text{Delivery Charge} + \text{Packing Charge} + \text{Admin Fee}) \times (1 + \text{Tax Rate})$$

### Parameter Breakdown:
- **Base Rate**: ₹50.00 (Fixed starting cost)
- **Weight Charge**: ₹0.02 × parcel weight in grams
- **Delivery Charges**:
  - Standard Delivery: ₹30.00
  - Express Delivery: ₹80.00
  - Same-Day Delivery: ₹150.00
- **Packing Charges**:
  - Basic Packing: ₹10.00
  - Premium Packing: ₹30.00
- **Admin Fee** (Officer bookings only): ₹50.00
- **Tax Rate**: 5% (`0.05`)

#### Example Calculation:
For a 2000g parcel with Express Delivery and Premium Packing booked by a customer:
$$\text{Cost} = (50 + (0.02 \times 2000) + 80 + 30) \times 1.05 = (50 + 40 + 80 + 30) \times 1.05 = 200 \times 1.05 = \mathbf{₹210.00}$$
